---------------------------------------------
I. RUNNING THE PROGRAM

There is no compiling needed.

To run the program, assure that it is globally
executable.  Thereafter, change directories
into the code directory.  Then enter the 
following

$ ./primecheck A

where A is an integer you would like to check
to verify whether or not it is a prime number.

Or to generate a prime number:

$ ./gen A

where A is an integer representing the number
of bits you'd like the prime number to be.

---------------------------------------------
II.  SOURCE CODE

The source code is also contained within the
gcd file.  Use any basic editor to view it.

---------------------------------------------
III. DOCUMENTATION

The required documentation resides in the
docs file.  The .pdf files are the visual 
copies. The .tex files are the source code.
