\textbf{Assignment Status: Complete}

The assignment is complete.

The program can do all of the required tasks.  I only mildly tested it to see whether or not it actually blocked traffic (I didn't want to mess up the rules my OS had put in place by default).

One known bug: Action/Protocol will allow you to enter invalid strings since when ruby converts strings to integers, it the given string is all characters it becomes a 0.  This zero then causes it to pass the type checking rules since it is now an integer.
