\textbf{Assignment Status: Complete}

The assignment is 100\% complete.

The program can successfully send, receive, encrypt and decrypt messages between a server and a client.  Moreover it does it quickly.

One thing to note, I combined server and client into one file for ease of use.  This way you only have to execute one script to get the results (instead of constantly stopping and starting two different scripts).  The read me explains how to execute the script.
