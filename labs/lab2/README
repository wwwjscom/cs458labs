---------------------------------------------
I. RUNNING THE PROGRAM

There is no compiling needed.

To run the program, assure that it is globally
executable.  Thereafter, change directories
into the code directory.  Then enter the 
following

$ ./primecheck A

where A is an integer you would like to check
to verify whether or not it is a prime number.

Or to generate a prime number:

$ ./gen A

where A is an integer representing the number
of bits you'd like the prime number to be.

Or to generate a public and private key pair:

$ ./keygen.rb A B

where A and B are two different prime numbers.

Or to encrypt a message

$ ./encrypt.rb N E M

where M is the message to be encrypted. N is
the base of the private key and E is the
exponent of the private key.

Or to decrypt a message

$ ./decrypt.rb N D M

where M is the message to be decrypted. N is
the base of the private key and D is the
exponent of the private key.

II.  SOURCE CODE

The source code is also contained within the
gcd file.  Use any basic editor to view it.

---------------------------------------------
III. DOCUMENTATION

The required documentation resides in the
docs file.  The .pdf files are the visual 
copies. The .tex files are the source code.
