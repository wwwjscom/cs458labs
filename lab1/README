I. RUNNING THE PROGRAM

There is no compiling needed.

To run the program, assure that it is globaly
executable.  Thereafter, change directories
into the code directory.  Then enter the 
following
$ ./gcd A B
where A and B represent the two integers you
wish to examine.

II.  SOURCE CODE

The source code is also contained within the
gcd file.  Use any basic editor to view it.

III. DOCUMENTATION

The required documentation resides in the
docs file.  The .pdf files are the visual 
copies. The .tex files are the source code.
